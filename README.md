# arch-texlive

<img src="logo.svg" height="240px" align="right"/>

Ready-to-use docker image of a full LaTeX installation on top of arch.

- __Arch-based.__ Always use the latest version of LaTeX.
- __Fonts included.__ Every Google font available.
- __CI/CD friendly.__ In case you're insane like me and want to compile
    documents inside a continuous integration pipeline.
- __Gigantic.__ OMEGABLOATED, somewhat around 6 GB on a single image.
